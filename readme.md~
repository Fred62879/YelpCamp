# COVID-19 Real Time Data Visualizer
This is the project directory for the COVID-19 data visualizer accomplished in GFN Hackathon in UBC.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run this program, only JDK is required and an IDE (e.g. Intellij) is suggested but not a requisite.

### Installing
The program operates with no problem on java-1.8.0-amazon-corretto. If you run into troubles on other versions, please download this JDK from [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-8-ug/downloads-list.html). For basic JDK setup, please refer [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sdk.html)

### Operating
The App.java file under src/main/gui directory is what should be run. Once the GUI is launched, you can choose to visualize the number of certain category of COVID-19 cases (confirmed, suspected, death, or cured) at specific area on a specific date. Once you finish the setup, click 'Search for...', and depending on your internet speed, the data will be retrieved from Chinese CDC API within 30s. The data will be both displayed in text format and visualized on Chinese map.
